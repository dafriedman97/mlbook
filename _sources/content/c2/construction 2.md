Construction
==============

This pages in this section construct classes to run the linear regression extensions discussed in the previous section. The {doc}`first <s2/regularized>` builds a Ridge and Lasso regression model, the {doc}`second <s2/bayesian>` builds a Bayesian regression model, and the {doc}`third <s2/GLMs>` builds a Poisson regression model.
