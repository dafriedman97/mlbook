# Construction

This section demonstrates constructions of bagging models, random forests, and boosting for classification and regression. Each of these relies on the decision tree constructions from the {doc}`last chapter </content/c5/construction>`. Bagging and random forests involve simple combinations of decision trees with only minor adjustments to the tree structure; therefore, the code for those sections is limited. The section on boosting involves more original code.
