# Concept

Due to their high variance, decision trees often fail to reach a level of precision comparable to other predictive algorithms. In the previous chapter, we introduced several ways to minimize the variance of a single decision tree, such as through pruning or direct size regulation. This chapter discusses another approach: *ensemble* methods. Ensemble methods combine the output of multiple simple models, often called "learners", in order to create a final model with lower variance.

We introduce ensemble methods in the context of tree-based learners though ensemble methods can be applied to a wide range of learning algorithms. That said, the structure of decision trees makes ensemble methods particularly valuable. Here we discuss three tree-based ensemble methods: *bagging*, *random forests*, and *boosting*.

An example demonstrating the power of ensemble methods is given below. Using the `tips` dataset from `scikit-learn`, we build several tree-based learners. Then for $b = 1, 2,  \dots, 30$, we use bagging to average the results of the $b$ learners. For each bagged model, we also calculate the out-of-sample $RSS$. The blue line below shows the $RSS$ for each bagged model—which clearly decreases with $b$—and the red line shows the $RSS$ for a single decision tree. By averaging many trees, rather than relying on a single one, we are able to improve the precision of our model.
