# Machine Learning from Scratch

Welcome to the repo for my free online book Machine Learning from Scratch. 
The book itself can be found [here](https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/introduction.html). 
(A somewhat ugly version of) the PDF can be found in the book.pdf file above in the `master` branch. Note that JupyterBook is currently [experimenting](https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/pdf.html) with the PDF creation.
For suggested changes to the book, please create pull requests to the `gh-pages` branch!

Any comments or questions are much appreciated, either here or via email at dafrdman@gmail.com.

Thanks so much!
